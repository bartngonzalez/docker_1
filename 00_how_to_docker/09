# 9. From the shell of a debian container, install via the containerâ€™s 
# package manager everything you need to compile C source code and push 
# it onto a git repo (of course, make sure before that the package 
# manager and the packages already in the container are updated).
# For this exercise, you should only specify the commands
# to be run directly in the container.

# Notes:
# For Alpine Linus use these commands
# apk update
# apk upgrade
# apk add git
